# Font Tester

This font tester is made by ChatGPT. 
I have no idea what is going on in the scripts.
The only things that I did were ask it what I want.
Whenever I encountered issues throw everything to it and then followed the instructions that it gave me...
I can not guarantee anything and I do not declare anything for the codes but feel free to use them. (It seems working:-))
